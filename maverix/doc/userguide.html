<h1><a name="_Toc39487180"></a>Overview</h1>
<p>
Mail Verification Exchange, Maverix, is an enterprise class
appliance that provides a secure anti-spam/anti-virus solution.&nbsp;
The solution eliminates spam by interrogating each email that
arrives.&nbsp; Emails from known spammers or spam domains are
immediately deleted.&nbsp; Emails from known senders or domains are
immediately delivered to the user&#8217;s inbox. However, emails from
unknown senders are challenged to one-time-verify as a valid Internet
sender intending to send valid email.&nbsp; This is accomplished
using our patent pending technology called Email Handshake
Verification.&nbsp; All emails from unknown senders are held in a
<i>quarantine database</i> until either the sender is verified by the
user, self-verified by the sender, or ultimately is deleted after 1,2
or 3 weeks (based on the user&#8217;s preferences).

<p>
See diagram 1 below.&nbsp; The sender self-verification option
sends a welcome message to the sender of an incoming email requesting
that the sender click on a web link to become a valid sender within
the user&#8217;s <i>whitelist</i>.&nbsp; However, if the
self-verification message bounces due to an &#8220;invalid user&#8221;
error, as they often do for spammers that spoof their origin using
invalid address, the sender is automatically be blocked.&nbsp; All of
these functions combine to greatly reduce the need for users to
micro-manage their anti-spam service or worry about lost email.</p>

<p>
With Maverix, you can:
<UL>
<LI>Stop spam before it reaches your desktop
    therefore reducing you Deleted folders and speeding up your email
    client performance
<LI>Prevent web-based HTML spam messages from
    generating pop-ups, displaying offensive material, or try to download
    destructive software
<LI>Eliminate viruses before they reach your computer
<LI>Prevent spam with embedded tracking ids that notify a spammer of the validity of your email address
<LI>Guarantee immediate delivery of all your valid email from desired senders
<LI>Allow senders to verify themselves so that their email is immediately delivered
<LI>Directly manage your personal settings
    including vacation, working hours, digest frequency, and other options
<LI>Maintain subscriptions to both external and internal mailing lists
<LI>Send mail within the company as well as to major everyday clients without anti-spam checking
</UL>

<h1><a name="_Toc39487181"></a>User Verification Process</h1>
<p>
All incoming email is interrogated to determine if the sender or
the sender domain is already on the user&#8217;s whitelist per
Diagram 1.&nbsp; If the sender is whitelisted, then the email is
immediately delivered to the user&#8217;s mail system.&nbsp; If the
system is blacklisted, then the email is dropped.&nbsp; If the sender
is not whitelisted or blacklisted, then the message is automatically
greylisted and quarantined while Maverix&#8217;s verification process
follows.
<P>

<p>
If the user has sender self-verification enabled, then the sender
will receive a verification handshake message from the Maverix
system.&nbsp; If the sender clicks on the &#8220;Verify&#8221; like
within the message, then the sender will be added to the user&#8217;s
whitelist.&nbsp; Otherwise, the user will periodically receive a
digest message that lists all email within the quarantine database.&nbsp;
The user will then select which senders to add to his personal
whitelist, to his blacklist, or the user can simply forward or drop
that specific message.

<p>
The Maverix system uses an internal email address such as
<a href="mailto:maverix@maverix.domain.com">maverix@maverix.domain.com</a>
when sending.&nbsp; Using this sender name helps prevent verification
message loops between two verification systems as well as clearly
identifies the system to the recipient. 

<p>
Maverix also uses a standard subject header when sending to a user
or sender:<P>
<B>&nbsp; Maverix Anti-Spam: 1 Message(s) pending verification</B>
<p>
The body of the Maverix quarantine digest message contains clear
instructions on how to manage the pending messages.<P>
Below is an example of a user quarantine digest message:
<hr size="2">

The following messages are awaiting your decision whether to permit or deny their delivery.

The user quarantine digest displays a summary of the emails
pending within the quarantine database.&nbsp; The user then has the
options to take the following actions on each message:

<p>
<UL>
<LI><b>Permit </b>- Allow this sender to always send email by adding
    the sender to the user&#8217;s whitelist
<LI><b><br>Block - </b>Deny all email from this sender by adding this sender to the user&#8217;s
    blacklist
<LI><b><br>Forward </b>- Forward only this message and the
    sender remains on the greylist
<LI><b><br>Drop </b>- Drop this particular
    message and the sender remains on the greylist
</UL>
<p>
When the user clicks on the first action, a new browser window
will launch and the user will see a complete listing of all
quarantined email awaiting the user&#8217;s actions.&nbsp; 

<p>
The user can either perform an action on each individual message
or can check the boxes to the left and perform an aggregate
operation:
<UL>
<LI><b>Permit Checked </b>&#8211; All senders with the box checked are
added to the user&#8217;s whitelist
<LI><b>Block Checked </b>- All senders with the box checked are added
to the user&#8217;s blacklist<b><br>Forward Checked </b>- All
messages with the box checked are delivered to the user and the
sender remains on the greylist
<LI><b>Drop Checked </b>- All messages with the box checked are
delivered to the user and the sender remains on the greylist
</UL>
<p>
Clicking on a link may sometimes produce the following error:
<p>
<font color="#ff0000">
 Sorry, that verification request in invalid,
 Please check for a more recent verification URL
</font>

<p>
Maverix uses a complex algorithm to generate its secure one-time,
short-lived URLs used for managing email delivery.&nbsp;
Periodically, the Maverix system will send a digest to the user and
will generate all new URLs used for the aforementioned actions.&nbsp;
When a new digest is generated, the old URLs are expired and the new
URLs are active.&nbsp; Because Maverix does not require for users to
remember more and more passwords, all security is managed using
short-lived URLs embedded within the email messages.&nbsp; The digest
messages are delivered directly to the user who must use a secure
email connection and password to receive the digest emails.&nbsp; In
fact, Maverix is password protected, not via additional passwords,
but rather using the existing one for regular email.&nbsp; 

<p>
Often, spammers send spam with unique sender addresses per spam,
like <a href="mailto:perf-message.16051754.0.0.4@somwhere.com">perf-message.16051754.0.0.4@somwhere.com</a>.&nbsp;
It is obvious that this spammer uses some sort of auto-generating
sender id for tracking the performance of the spamming campaign.&nbsp;
Since it will be unlikely to see this sender id again, dropping the
particular message from the Maverix server will have the same effect
as blocking the sender.

<p>
Dropping spam on the Maverix server instead of within the client
software provides a variety of advantages.&nbsp; Many spammers use a
brute force <i>dictionary attack</i> against a corporate mail gateway
and embed tracking objects within HTML messages to determine whether
an email address is valid or not.&nbsp; Since Maverix drops the email
at the server, spammers are unable to track the success of their
campaigns.&nbsp; Other benefits of dropping unwanted email on the
server include prevention of viruses, pop-ups, security
vulnerabilities within the email client, and less consumption of
system resources

<h1><a name="_Toc39487182"></a>Sender Verification Process</h1>

<p>
Sender verification is a highly valuable option that allows for
new senders to immediately deliver their email to intended users.&nbsp;
Upon sending an email to a Maverix user, the sender will immediately
receive a challenge handshake message to ensure that the sender is in
fact a real user on the Internet intending to send a message.&nbsp;
Below is an example, of a typical Maverix challenge handshake
message:
<p>
<hr size="2">
<p>&nbsp;
<p>
You have recently sent an email message to address specified below. In order to have your message
delivered, click on <b>Verify</b> link after each email address:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>joeuser@somecompany.com <a href="javascript:;" target="Mvrx">Verify</a>
</ul>
<p>
Once you have verified, your E-mail will be allowed to pass through and you
will be put on list of verified addresses and you will not have to go
through this process again.
<p>
<hr size="2">
<p>&nbsp;
<p>
Often a spammer uses a spoofed email address and therefore the
challenge message bounces due to an &#8220;invalid user&#8221;
error.&nbsp; Maverix will automatically drop any challenge messages
that bounce from an explicit invalid user error message.&nbsp; This
does not mean that if a sender&#8217;s emails server is down, then
email will get dropped.&nbsp; A message is only dropped if the bounce
contains an <i>invalid user</i> error message which is distinctively
different from other errors.&nbsp; Email should be sent with valid
return sender email addresses.&nbsp; If there is an invalid email
address that should directly deliver email to a user, then the user
can enter that address within the user preferences interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h1><a name="_Toc39487183"></a>User Preference Parameters</h1>
<P>
In the top right hand corner of each user digest browser, opened after clicking on the
first action, is a link to the user&#8217;s individual account
settings.

<h2><a name="_Toc39487184"></a>Spam Blocked</h2>
<P>
The <b>Spam Blocked</b> value is a counter that tracks all spam either auto-blocked via
bounced challenges or blocked via the user blacklist or user drop.</font></p>
<p>
There should be five TABs listed in the top right corner:</p>
<p>
<UL>
<LI><B>Messages</B> - Displays all actionable messages pending within the quarantine database.&nbsp;
    User can then Permit, Block, Forward, Drop email messages.
<LI><B>Properties</B> - User interface for customizing email parameters
<LI><B>Whitelist</B> &#8211; <font face="Arial">Shows
    all senders and domains allowed to directly send mail to users
<LI><B>Blacklist</B> - Shows all senders and domains that are denied from sending email
<LI><B>Greylist</B> - Shows all senders that are pending verification
</UL>

<h2><a name="_Toc39487185"></a>Messages</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font face="Arial">The <b>Messages</b>
TAB is displayed by default and should show all messages within the

    will receive challenge messages
<LI><B>I want all email pass through directly to my mailbox</B> - All email for the

    typically the Default mode for installation.
<LI><B>Digest with unverified messages/senders will be sent every</B> -
    Periodic interval that the digest message will be
    sent to the user.&nbsp; A good default value is every two hours.&nbsp;
    Maverix will not blindly fill up the user&#8217;s mailbox with digest
    messages but will instead intelligently handle digest management.
<LI><B><font face="Arial">Digest will be sent within this period of day</B> - 
    This is the &#8220;working day&#8221; start and stop time that the digest
    messages will be delivered.&nbsp; This is so that Maverix doesn&#8217;t
    continue to send digests after hours.&nbsp; The &#8220;From&#8221;
    time is that start of the day at which digests begin and the &#8220;To&#8221;
    is the time at which they stop.
