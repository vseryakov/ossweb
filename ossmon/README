    received from remote devices

  - supports small and middle size networks
  - turnkey installation, no external dependencies, everything runs
    on Naviserver, Net-SNMP agents are reqired for OSSMON-MIB
    support but optional
  - easy and intuitive web interface, usefull immediately after installation
  - extensible architecture, adding new devices and monitoring is easy,
    just implement one procedure for any specific protocol and OSSMON
    will take care of the rest

  - PostgreSQL as database backend
  - Net-SNMP agent is Tcl script which extends snmpd to support
    OSSMON-MIB variables and tables such as syslogTable, psTable,
    netstatTable, pingTable
